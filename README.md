# Calculate_Pb_Pressure
Simple GUI for easily calculating sample pressure based on the superconducting transition temperature of lead.
Written by Evan Telford (ejt2133@columbia.edu).

1. Run the program Calculate_Pb_Pressure.py
2. Enter the superconducting transition temperature of Pb in Kelvin
3. Click "Calculate Pressure".
4. The calculated pressure will be displayed.

Note: the calculation of Pb assumes a negligible measuring field and a linear approximation for dTc/dP.
